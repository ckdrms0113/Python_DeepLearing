My Python Learning Journey 🚀
📌 Introduction
This repository is a collection of code and projects that I have worked on while learning Python.
I aim to reinforce my understanding by writing and applying code, rather than just studying concepts theoretically.

📖 How I Study Python
I focus on hands-on learning rather than passive studying. My approach includes:

Learning fundamental concepts (syntax, data structures, algorithms)
Project-based learning (solving real-world problems and building small applications)
Analyzing open-source projects and real-world code
Continuously improving and optimizing my own code
🎯 My Learning Focus
Currently, I am particularly interested in:

Algorithms & Data Structures 🧠
Automation & Scripting ⚙️
Data Analysis & Visualization 📊
Web Development (Flask, Django) 🌐
I plan to continue learning and documenting my progress along the way.

💾 My Code Repository
The code in this repository is based on what I have learned and experimented with.
I am always working on debugging, improving performance, and writing better code.
Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!

📌 Check out the README files in each project folder for more details.
