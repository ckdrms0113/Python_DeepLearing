## My Python Learning Journey 🚀
# 📌 Introduction
This repository documents my learning journey in Python, focusing on AI, machine learning, and CNN-based object classification models.
I have been experimenting with different models, training them, and applying them to real-world use cases while improving my understanding of AI concepts.

# 📖 How I Study Python
Rather than just learning theory, I take a project-based approach to reinforce my knowledge.
My study process includes:

Fundamental Concepts: Understanding Python syntax, algorithms, and data structures
AI & Machine Learning Models: Training CNN-based object classification models and exploring ML techniques
Project-Based Learning: Applying trained models in real-world applications and optimizing performance
Analyzing and Improving Open-Source Code: Understanding existing models and enhancing them
# 🎯 My Learning Focus
I am currently interested in the following areas:

CNN-based Object Classification Models 🖼️
Machine Learning for Data Analysis 📊
Automation and Optimization Techniques ⚙️
AI Projects Using Python 🤖
I plan to continue experimenting with new models, documenting my progress, and sharing my findings.

# 💾 My Code Repository
This repository contains code that I have written based on my learning experiences.
It includes experiments with machine learning and deep learning models, along with gradual improvements and optimizations.
Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
